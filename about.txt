This code processes each page of a PDF by converting it into images, detecting barcodes on each page, and printing the barcode data along with its coordinates. Here's a summary of what the code does:

PDF to Image Conversion:

The PDF is converted into images using pdf2image, where each page is treated as a separate image.
Image Processing:

For each image, the code converts it from RGB to grayscale using OpenCV's cvtColor function.
Barcode Detection:

The grayscale image is processed using the pyzbar library to detect any barcodes on the page.
Barcode Data Extraction:

If barcodes are detected, the barcode data is decoded into a human-readable format (usually a string).
Barcode Coordinates:

For each barcode, its polygon coordinates (corner points) are extracted and printed. These coordinates represent the bounding box around the detected barcode.
Output:

For each page, if barcodes are found, the barcode data and coordinates are printed. If no barcodes are found, a message is printed indicating that no barcodes were detected on that page.
The output includes the following details for each page:

Page number.
Barcode data (the information stored in the barcode).
Coordinates of the barcode on the page, represented as polygon points.
If no barcodes are found on a page, it will simply output that no barcodes were detected.
